Citi does not have a data centre space on premier supply chain, and their current cloud provider (AWS), cannot meet requirements, POC failed. IBM engagement : IBM helped Citi to establish aa high-performance computing platform, where they can run the necessary analytics to stay compliant with financial regulations. Successful POC completed Jan-2022. Citi will get a managed service from IBM for high performance computing and grid computing workloads. The Citi HPC Platform is set up and managed using IBM Services and automation. Citi Business value : Establish a High-Performance Computing platform where Citi can ensure they are running the necessary analytics to stay compliant with the OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ) consent order. \u2022 Single provider accountability for the ACE/SIMPLICITY HPC grid solution \u2022 Ability to meet price and schedule requirements and helping satisfy compliance needs IBM Value Proposition(Citi HPC): This engagement will give IBM their 1st Cloud foothold at Citi to prove IBM value and give us the opportunity to increase Cloud Market share at Citi. We\u2019re in discussion with client to double the platform size and revenue. This will be a first of a kind (FOAK) service for IBM that can be replicated across other clients. Established comprehensive executive involvement and holistic governance. Worked closely with IBM Cloud, Symphony, Scale, and Red Hat SMEs to swiftly address high-priority issues through collaboration. Introduced custom solutions for logging and monitoring Enacted the Squad model with well-defined roles and responsibilities. Established an Eyes on Glass team responsible for monitoring 18 clusters. Architectural issues e.g. Spectrum Scale Storage Solution for Distributed File System (DFS) approach resulted in disk space issues and storage un-availability. PES team helped to implement the Multiple File System to overcome the challenges. Hasty Migration from AWS to IBM Cloud resulted in insufficient testing, leading to performance issues affecting RATES and EQT. PES team helped to enhance the master node size and fine-tuning configuration parameters. Citi HPC - POC completed and demonstrated to client greatly influenced awarding of this contract. The migration of the ACE and EQT applications from on-premises to MFS led to additional work for Asset and CDT. IBM proposed a solution that enabled Citi to reduce their monthly costs to USD 5m /month by implementing a fixed-capacity environment for running critical workloads on the IBM Cloud."

Improved customer servicing in SAMM by addressing various issues related to: Servicing of mortgage/current/child trust fund accounts Management of customer contact details, ID verification, account documents etc. 2. Relaxed validation rule on few integration services to better handle special characters coming from system of records. This had a direct impact on customer servicing through SAMM and has improved the user experience in SAMM significantly. 3. Improved customer experience through Amazon Connect by fixing incorrect load balancing for telephone banking component. 4. Performance improvement to database to address the availability issues of Internet Bank Admin App. This has increased the availability of admin app to contact centres, fraud teams and reduced the callouts made to App Support team. 5. Improved downloading of the current account transactions in OFX format from Internet Bank after the introduction of Fairer Share payments. 6.

Citi does not have a data centre space on premier supply chain, and their current cloud provider (AWS), cannot meet requirements, POC failed. IBM engagement : IBM helped Citi to establish aa high-performance computing platform, where they can run the necessary analytics to stay compliant with financial regulations. Successful POC completed Jan-2022. Citi will get a managed service from IBM for high performance computing and grid computing workloads. The Citi HPC Platform is set up and managed using IBM Services and automation.

We\u2019re in discussion with client to double the platform size and revenue. This will be a first of a kind (FOAK) service for IBM that can be replicated across other clients. Established comprehensive executive involvement and holistic governance. Worked closely with IBM Cloud, Symphony, Scale, and Red Hat SMEs to swiftly address high-priority issues through collaboration. Introduced custom solutions for logging and monitoring Enacted the Squad model with well-defined roles and responsibilities. Established an Eyes on Glass team responsible for monitoring 18 clusters. Architectural issues e.g. Spectrum Scale Storage Solution for Distributed File System (DFS) approach resulted in disk space issues and storage un-availability. PES team helped to implement the Multiple File System to overcome the challenges. Hasty Migration from AWS to IBM Cloud resulted in insufficient testing, leading to performance issues affecting RATES and EQT. PES team helped to enhance the master node size and fine-tuning configuration parameters. Citi HPC - POC completed and demonstrated to client greatly influenced awarding of this contract. The migration of the ACE and EQT applications from on-premises to MFS led to additional work for Asset and CDT.

Generated Microservices code and chassis components using Microservices Builder (DMB) accelerator. Implemented reusable common components for error and exception handling. Implemented the code as per existing business logic and then uplifted/optimized the same to fix potential functional, performance and quality issues. The newly developed microservices are highly configurable to support quick feature enhancement, scalability and maintainability.

The Basic Infrastructure will always be open for business, 24/7/365. The Fast Settlement Service The Fast Settlement Service (FSS) is provided by the Reserve Bank of Australia. This world-leading capability enables every single payment made on the platform, regardless of its size, to be settled in real-time in central bank funds, across each financial institution\u2019s Exchange Settlement Account (ESA). Overlay Services \u2018Overlay Service\u2019 is the name the industry has given to innovation that can leverage the benefits of the Basic NPP Infrastructure. These products or services could offer vastly different user experiences, and in many cases could compete with each other. This is where the New Payments Platform breathes life into innovation and competition. The Platform uses ISO 20022 for electronic data interchange between financial institutions or organizations able to move money and data. The benefit of ISO 20022 is that it is a global standard with messages able to convey more data than legacy messaging formats. FIs regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Authorized Deposit-taking Institutions) can connect to the platform via NPP Payment Gateways. The scope of the New Payments Platform is comprised in three primary components (Bi-lateral Clearing, Tri-lateral Settlement Model):"

Client Challenges In order to realize the Client strategic programme in the area of payments processing, a \u2018state-of-the-art\u2019 payments infrastructure was needed. Client wanted to have visibility to the transactions as they pass through that was not available in other solutions evaluated by them. In the recent years a lot has been done by introducing SEPA and the SEPA payments application architecture. In house solution was custom built and too expensive to extend & customize IBM Solution IBM proposed Financial Transaction Manager (FTM) for integration between various systems. This layer will provide full track and trace capabilities for payment orders and transactions in it. It also has alerting capabilities in case of issue in processing this also can be followed by business interventions in order to overcome the issue. FTM has been implemented. Design activity for the pilot has been completed. Development is underway and is nearing completion. Agile development methodology is being followed to increase frequency of deployment and transparency to the business."
